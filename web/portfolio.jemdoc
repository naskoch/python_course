= CME 193 - Introduction to Scientific Python

== Portfolio

You are required to submit a portfolio with all your work for this class.
The portfolio should demonstrate that you attempted the assigned exercises,
and that you have gained a basic understanding of Python.

*You are only expected to do 2/3rds of the exercises, so feel free to skip ones
that you don't like.
Also, there is no need for a writeup.*
For example, for the first few exercises, you won't write any scripts.
You therefore don't have to add your work for those exercises to your portfolio.

While you should not devote time and energy to making the portfolio extra
pretty, you are expected to hand files that are well structured and your
code should be well commented.

You should submit the portfolio as a /zip/ file to the Dropbox on Canvas.
The portfolio should have the following structure

- A folder for every section in the exercises file (e.g. a folder /basics/).
- A single /py/ file per exercise, named according to the exercise name.
