\titledquestion{Swapping two values} % (fold)
\label{sub:swapping_two_values}

Suppose you have two variables: \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}.
Now you want to set \texttt{a} equal to the value of \texttt{b} and at
 the same time set \texttt{b} equal to the value of \texttt{a}.

The following obviously does not work
\begin{verbatim}
    a = b
    b = a
\end{verbatim}
so in some languages, you need to define a third variable like this
\begin{verbatim}
    t = a
    a = b
    b = t
\end{verbatim}
However, in Python you don't need to do this. How can you swap \texttt{a} and
\texttt{b} in one line?

\titledquestion{Zip} % (fold)
\label{sub:zip}

Suppose we have two lists, \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} that give the $x$ and $y$
coordinates of a set of points. Create a list with the coordinates (x,y) as a tuple.
Hint: Find out about the \texttt{zip} function.

You have decided that actually, you need the two seperate lists, but unfortunately,
you have thrown them away.
How can we use zip to \emph{unzip} the list of tuples to get two lists again?

\titledquestion{Distances} % (fold)
\label{sub:zip}

Suppose we have two vectors, \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}, stored as tuples with $n$ elements.
Implement functions that compute the $l_1$ and $l_2$ distances between \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
Note that $n$ is not explicitly given.
