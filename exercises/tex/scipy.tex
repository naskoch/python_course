\titledquestion{Least squares} % (fold)
\label{sub:least_squares}

Generate matrix $A \in R^{m \times n}$ with $m > n$.
Also generate some vector $b \in R^m$.

Now find $x = \arg\min_x \|Ax-b\|_2$.

Print the norm of the residual.

\label{sub:optimization}

Find the maximum of the function
\[
    f(x) = \sin^2(x-2)e^{-x^2}
\]

\titledquestion{Pairwise distances} % (fold)
\label{sub:pairwise_dists}

Let $X$ be a matrix with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.
How can you compute the pairwise distances between every two rows?

As an example application, consider $n$ cities, and we are given their coordinates
in two columns.
Now we want a nice table that tells us for each two cities, how far they
are apart.

Again, make sure you make use of Scipy's functionality instead of writing your own routine.
