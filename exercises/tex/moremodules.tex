\titledquestion{Regular expressions to find email addresses}

At \url{http://stanford.edu/~schmit/cme193/ex/data/emailchallenge.txt} you find
some text data with some email addresses.
Your task is to write a script that finds these email addresses (and ignores the fake ones).

First, use the \texttt{requests} library to download the data directly into Python (so don't save the file locally).
Then use \texttt{re} to match the email addresses.
Make sure to extract the local part and domain part (before and after \texttt{@}) separately.

You should find 7 email addresses.

Hint: Although written for the Ruby regex, \url{http://rubular.com/} can be very useful
to play around with your pattern. The Python regular expression should be identical or almost identical.

\titledquestion{Flask}

Write a Flask app that displays the current date and time.

Hint: Use the \texttt{datetime} module to get the current time.
