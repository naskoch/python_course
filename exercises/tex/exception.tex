        Edit your code that implements the \texttt{Rational} class such that
        it raises an exception when the denominator is $0$.

    \titledquestion{Wordcount} % (fold)
    \label{sub:wordcount}

        Recall the exercise of finding the 20 most common words in the Complete
        works of Shakespeare.

        Write a script, reusing as much of your code as you can, such that you can specify the filename and k for the k most common words at the command line
        and that the script will print the k most
        common words, and their counts, from the file.

        Make sure you handle errors gracefully, such as a misspecified filename.
