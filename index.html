<h1>CME 193 - Introduction to Scientific Python</h1>
</div>
<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>This short course runs for the first four and a half weeks of the quarter and is
offered each quarter during the academic year.
It is recommended for students who want to use Python in math, science,
or engineering courses and for students who want to learn the basics of
Python programming, and learn about relevant applications.</p>
<p>The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with Pythonâ€™s
tools for scientific computing.
Lectures will be interactive with a focus on learning by example, and
assignments will be application-driven.
Topics covered include control flow, basic data structures, File IO,
and an introduction to NumPy and SciPy.</p>
<h2>Course information</h2>
<p>CME 193 - Introduction to Scientific Python - Spring 2015</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Location: Hewlitt Teaching Center 200</p>
</li>
<li><p>Times: Tuesdays and Thursdays 10:30 am - 11:50 am (9<i>29 - 10</i>25)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructor:
Nolan Skochdopole (naskoch at stanford dot edu)</p>
<p>Office hours: Wednesdays, 2 pm - 4 pm and by appointment.</p>
<p>We will be using Canvas for course communication.</p>
<h2>Course prereqs</h2>
<p>There are no formal prerequisites.
However, past experience has shown that people with no programming experience
will struggle with the pace and have to put in a lot of hours, as if it were a three unit course.
Hence, <b>some prior programming experience in some language is strongly encouraged</b>.</p>
<p>If you have no programming experience, and you still want to take to course, please consider
completing an introduction of Python on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python">Codeacademy</a>
and/or <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101">Udacity</a> before class starts.
This should get you up to speed!</p>
<h2>Course Policy</h2>
<p>The course consists of 8 lectures.
Roughly the first half is a traditional lecture, and after a short
minute break, we will spend the rest of the time working on exercises in class.
Hence, please bring a laptop.</p>
<p>Exercises will be assigned each class.</p>
<h2>Honor code</h2>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss both exercises and
other homework.
However, the portfolio and other homework should be your own work and all the code
you submit should be written by yourself.
Of course, you are free, and encouraged, to search online to solutions to
problems you run into (though not full solutions to the exercises), and
use those.
A simple example would be to look up the syntax of a <tt>for</tt> loop.</p>
